# DevMountain CS 

## What's the point?

Computer Science is the basis for everything you've learned at DevMountain. There are two main purposes to this additional series of classes. The first purpose is to make sure you are the most prepared and able job candidates that you can be. Knowing these principles will help you perform betting in challenging interviews and will help you be more confident in all potential job oportunities. If you don't get a job, then it will be much harder to put into practice everything that you've learned here at DevMountain. The second purpose of this course is to make sure when you do get your dream job that you will be as well prepared as possible to make well designed and efficient code. The better you understand these concepts the more clearly you will be able to think about your program in general and over time writing well designed code will become natural and instinctive. By well designed code we mean that the code is easily reusable, testable and maintainable.


# Learning Objectives
