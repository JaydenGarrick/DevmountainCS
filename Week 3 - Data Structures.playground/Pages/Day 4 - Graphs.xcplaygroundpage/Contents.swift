// Week 3 - Day 4 - Graphs



// Some inherently complex problems.
// 1. Travel from point A to point B.
// 2. Represent all the friends one has on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
// 3. The London Underground.
// 4. All the flights in the world for a particular airline.
// 5. How do I create a World Wide Web and do networking from one side of the world to the other?














































// What is a Graph? Is a set of vertecies and a set of edges that connects those vertecies.

// Definitions
// 1. Vertex or Nodes - A dot or a space on the graph that represents a state.
// 2. Edge, links, ties, or relations - Represents some connection between two nodes.
// 3. Adjacency - When two nodes are connected by one edge.
// 4. Path - When a node is connected to another node by one or more edges.
// 5. Loop - An edge that connects one node back to itself.
// 6. Parallel Edges - A duplicate edge that connects the same two nodes.
// 7. Degree of a Vertex - The number of edges out of that node. In Directed Graphs this can be broken into an in degree and an out degree.
// 8. Pendent Vertex - A node that has only one edge.
// 9. Isolated Vertex - A node with zero edges.











































// Types of Graphs

// 1. Null Graph - Is a graph with no edges.
// 2. Trivial Graph - A graph with only one node and no edges.
// 3. Non-Directed Graph - Each of the edges are bi-directional. {a,b}
// 4. Directed Graph - Edges only go one way. (a,b)
// 5. Simple Graph - A graph with no loops and no parallel edges.
//      1. The max number of edges possible is n(n-1)/2 where n is the number of vertecies.
//      2. The max number of graphs with n vertecies is 2^(n(n-1)/2)
// 6. Connected Graph - All the nodes are connected in the graph.
// 7. Disconnected Graph - Not all the nodes are connected.
// 8. Regular Graph - A graph where all of the nodes have the same degree.
// 9. Complete Graph - All nodes have a direct connection to every other node.
// 10. Cyclic Graph -
// 11. Acyclic Graph -
